"""Choosing how one stage's output reaches the next stage.

Two ways exist and both must keep working:

  relay   stage -> agent -> orchestrator -> agent -> stage
          Always available. The worker only dials out, so nothing needs an open
          port and no NAT has to be defeated. Costs two wide-area crossings.

  direct  stage -> agent =====> agent -> stage
          One crossing. Needs a libp2p route to the neighbour, which succeeds
          for roughly two pairs in three; symmetric NATs defeat it entirely.

This module owns the choice, per neighbour, at the moment a message is sent.
The rule is deliberately dull: use the direct link when one is known to be up,
otherwise relay, and never let a direct-path failure lose a token. A pipeline
that silently drops to relay is slower; a pipeline that drops a message is
broken, and the difference is the whole reason the fallback exists.

Nothing above this module knows which path was taken. The stage process still
POSTs to the agent's loopback relay exactly as before.
